//I JUST CREATED THIS FILE TO WRITE THINGS I NEED TO COMPLETE LATER ON 
//IN THE PROJECT

//1. Page_transitons for every pushing of pages

//2. Grid View of hymns(a card design).. 
//...for Landscape View Mode to have a responsive app....
//....(present design looks ugly in tablet sized devices)

//3. Constraint Size for maintext field

//4. Complete 500 hymns with both lang and write more test...
//...to check integrity of the hymns_data

//5. I must write at least 2 widget_test.
 
//6. The Repo for this project is a mess, I need to work on it...
//...don't forget to add a license to the repo(Man must guide always....
//....never loose guard).

//7. Read on how to update apps on play console.

//8. Implement ValuNotifier for Ephemeral State Management

//9. Add bottom view padding to main text field
